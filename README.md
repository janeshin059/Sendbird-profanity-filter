# Sendbird-profanity-filter

ðŸ‘‰ Replaces explicit words with asterisks(*) using Sendbird [profanity filter](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/filter-and-moderation#2-profanity-filter) and sends push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

> I picked 3 words from Star Wars series for test purpose: `fuzzball,buckethead,flyboy` but feel free to use other words in your own app!
